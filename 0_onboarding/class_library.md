## Class Library

As a student/alumni of the GA Chicago Community you have access to our WDI library. It is located on the 5th Floor in SPACE in the staff office. Please ask a staff member to return books in or hand one off to you.

#### Authentication
We require the use of Github for authentication. Github accounts are free! You can sign up for an account here: https://github.com/join

#### Using our app and viewing the library’s Titles
You may browse the books at http://ga­-chicago­-library.herokuapp.com/

#### Library Lending Policy and usage
You are allowed to have one book checked out for a maximum of three (3) business days. At any point, we may request a book to be returned; if must be on you if you are at on the General Assembly Campus. Once you have decided on a book to borrow, use the application listed above to “check out” the application. Once you return the book, open and the app again and you will be prompted to check your book back in. It is as simple as that! Note: You may continuously re­check a book out unless otherwise noted.

#### Contacting the library’s administrators
If you need to make arrangements or would like to provide suggestions for the library, you may contact us via email at (jamest@ga.co). We understand that things happen and if something comes up, please reach out to us. We’re here to assist you.

#### About the Github authentication
When you first browse to the application, you will be asked to authenticate with Github. Please select allow if you are prompted. You will be redirected to Github.com to authenticate on their secure (SSL) servers. After logging in, you will be redirected to the application to peruse the library.
