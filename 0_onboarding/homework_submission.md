- Based on each project's rubric, it may be assessed as **complete**, **incomplete**, or **missing**.
- Students should expect feedback 24-48 hours after an assignment's due date.
- Students that submit homework late will need to request an instructor to review it (as we may not notice it).

- Students will present their project in a presentation and perform an in-class peer code review.

#### Homework Submission

> This submission process will be covered in class.

  0. You will be assigned homework from a specific Git repository.
  1. Browse to `wdi/name_of_your_project`
  2. `git add .` all of your changes to the Git purgatory.
  3. `git commit -m "your commit message"` to commit your changes from the Git purgatory into your branch.
  4. `git pull upstream master` to gather any changes from the base repository
  5. `git push origin master` to push your changes to your own fork!
  6. Inside of your fork, create a new **pull request**.
  7. Submit the pull request for your instructors to check!

That's all! We will practice this workflow during class repeatedly to get you comfortable with it.

#### Office Hours

- Once a week, each instructors will be available from 5pm until 6pm after class.
- Students will be informed of these office hours and where they are located depending on the week.
