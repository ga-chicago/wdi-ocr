## Welcome from your instructors

Hi there! You're about to embark upon some of the most intense moments of your life in the next twelve weeks. This WDI program in Chicago is rigorous and expects for each student to give 110%. Your cohort will be unique and ever-evolving; if you have any suggestions, questions, or comments - please let us know. We want to create the best learning experience possible. We'll collect your feedback and iterate on it each week. While this cohort will be intense, once you complete it you will have a strong understanding of web development and understand the fundamentals of computer science. Twelve weeks from now you will understand _how_ to learn in the world of software development.

## Pre-Work

WDI requires for you to complete https://fundamentals.generalassemb.ly prior to the first day of WDI. **If you have not completed this by day one, speak to your producer or instructor immediately**.

## Recommend Reading

Prior to starting the course, we highly encourage students to take a look at Shay Howe's (product manager at Belly) Learn HTML & CSS book (it is available for [free here](http://learn.shayhowe.com/)). Try to read the first three chapters prior to starting class; however read as much as you have time for.

## Development Environment

WDI has a strict class policy of only supporting Mac OS. Because we teach Ruby and Node, we cannot allow Windows machines into the class as many Ruby libraries will **not work** on Windows. Linux machines may be considered on a case-by-case basis if a student has a strong knowledge of the Linux command line however the instructional staff **will not** support those machines.
