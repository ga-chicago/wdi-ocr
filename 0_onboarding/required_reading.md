## Required Reading

The WDI class has required reading for homework on occasion. These are from freely available and legal sources.

* [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke (Creative Commons)
* [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/) by Shaye Howe
* [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/) by Zed Shaw

## Highly Suggested Reading

We highly recommend reading Sandi Metz's **Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby** when we begin covering Ruby in class. This is a paid book but it is (in our opinion) a vital read for this cohort.

> *Note!* [GA Students receive 50% off ebooks and 40% off print books from O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/deals/general-assembly.do?cmp=ex-na-books-videos-lp-promo_general_assembly).
