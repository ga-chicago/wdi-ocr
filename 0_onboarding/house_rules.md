## House Rules

* Follow Wheaton’s Law in this class.
* **Your points of contact are Kevin, James, and Jim**.
* **Kristan Saloky** is our **Campus Commander**. She runs the house.
* Treat everyone with respect - your fellow students, front lines staff, instructors, and everyone.
* Always have your laptop ready to be used.
* Clean up after yourselves (don’t leave glasses and coffee mugs out; place dirty dishes in the dishwasher or sink).
* Leave your workspace better than you found it (clean up after yourself).
* Keep the aisles of the classroom clear (no book bags, messenger bags, or purses).
* Don’t slam the door to the classroom if you need to get up and use the bathroom, take a call, etc.
* Utilize the coat rack to hang your jackets up.
* Do not play music, video games, or anything else that can distract someone around you during class. Headphones are okay when there is downtime or when we're working on a lab, though!
* You may utilize SPACE during their normal hours of operation. The doors open 8:30am and close at 10pm.
* If you would like to use a conference room, please ask an instructor first.
* The fridge is cleaned out every Friday afternoon.
* Don't abuse the keg.
* Do not torrent during class. Our host provider *will* catch you.
