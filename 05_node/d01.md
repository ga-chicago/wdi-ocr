#### Reading

You should read [Javascript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/). It is a fun, friendly read. As you read through it, take notes of concepts that are still hazy for you and bring them up tomorrow.

You should also read [this chapter on HTTP](http://eloquentjavascript.net/17_http.html) in Eloquent Javascript if you did not earlier in the class.
