* Write down any/all questions you have from this week. We'll cover them tomorrow during second pass Friday.

#### Optional Homework

**#1:** Arrays

* In your `code/homework/your_name` folder, `touch thurs_fun_arrays.js`.
* Use a `for` loop, a `while` loop, and another loop **of your choice** to `console.log()` each item in the array.
* The array to loop through: `var places = ['adler', 'science and industry', 'field museum', 'art institute', 'millenium park', 'river north', 'local 22', 'the L'];`

**#2**: Objects

* In your `code/homework/your_name` folder, `touch thurs_fun_objects.js`.
* Define an Object that represents your favourite thing in the world.
* Give it 5-10 attributes with values that are *not* `undefined` or `null`
* Use a `for` loop, a `while` loop, and another loop **of your choice** to `console.log()` each key and corresponding value in the Object.

#### Hints

```js
var obj = {
 shit: 'stuff',
 snakes: 'on a plane',
 mushrooms: 'glow',
 fallout: 'shelters'
}
for (var item in obj) {
    console.log(item + ": " + obj[item]);
}
var arr = ["jack sparrow", "blackbeard", "sinbad"];
for (var index in arr) {
    console.log(index + ": " + arr[index]);
}
```
