## Chrome developer tools are super cool, use them!!!!

The developer tools allow you to run javascript code in the browser, and are great for debugging!

To open the developer tools we use the keyboard shortcut `cmd + opt + I` or we can right click on the page and choose `inspect`, but why would we do all of that....


####  Cool Dev tool commands from the console

*  `$_`  Returns the value of the most recently evaluated expressions
*  `up arrow` allows you to scroll through recently typed commands, just like in terminal
*  `$0 - $4` `$0` return the most recently selected element or javascript object and so on up to `$4`
*  `$$('css selector')` returns an array of the matched elements
*  `control + L`  clears the console
