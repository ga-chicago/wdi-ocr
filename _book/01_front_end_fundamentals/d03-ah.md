## Homework: Mid-Week Recap

Let's take a few moments this evening to reflect upon what we have studied. Below are a few problems to solve this evening that will work in what you've learned. Solve these problems and then test them in Google Chrome. Place all of these in `01_front_end_fundamentals/your_name/day3_homework.js`. We will create pull requests tomorrow in class to handle the submission.

#### 1. Detecting Types

* Create a re-usable construct in Javascript (..you know, keeping things *DRY*..).
* It should accept **one** argument of any variable.
* This construct should **return** the *type of* the variable that is the argument.

#### 2. Carousel

* Create an array that represents people hopping off a carousel.
* Loop through the carousel using a **for** loop. Every other cycle through the loop (odd), someone will hop off.
* Repeat until the carousel is empty.

#### 3. You are an object...

* Create an object that represents yourself.
* Assign ten attributes about yourself to this object.
* Use a **foreach** (*for-in*) loop to list all of these *attributes* (and the *keys* that they are associated with).

#### 4. Elementary School

* In elementary school, when you divide you typically use division and have to report the remainder.
* Create a function that returns a string.
* It will accept two arguments: a number, and a number to divide that number against.
* The returned string should state what the result is **and** the remainder.
* You will need to use the `/` and the `%` operators.
