## HTML/CSS Basics

Every HTML file should be thought of as a document. HTML is a markup language. Markup languages describe content - they don't take input or return output like programming languages do.

The DOM stands for the __Document Object Model__. It's your browser's interpretation of the code you wrote. Your browser may interpret your HTML differently than how you wrote it. [This article explains it better than I did in class](https://css-tricks.com/dom/).

The pre-work covered HTML and CSS and you guys are clearly very familiar with it so here's a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript playground you can use to test your skills:

- Use CSS to change the colors and sizes of text and other elements on the page
- Add a title to the top of the page in HTML
- Use JavaScript to loop over the `posts` array and output the front page of an example blog
