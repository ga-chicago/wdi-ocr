## Colour Theory

* Two types of colour - colours you can **touch** and color you **can't touch**.
* Touched colours are called *subtractive*; *additive* is colour you can't touch.
* Subtractive is measured in CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow)
* Additive is measured by RGB (red, green, blue)
* Humans process color via HSL - hue, saturation, lightness
