##Introduction

The Document Object Model, or DOM, is the interface that allows you to programmatically access and manipulate the contents of a web page (or document). It provides a structured, object-oriented representation of the individual elements and content in a page with methods for retrieving and setting the properties of those objects. It also provides methods for adding and removing such objects, allowing you to create dynamic content.

The DOM also provides an interface for dealing with events, allowing you to capture and respond to user or browser actions. This feature is briefly covered here but the details are saved for another article. For this one, the discussion will be on the DOM representation of a document and the methods it provides to access those objects.

##Example

You may access the DOM in Javascript via:

```javascript
// vanilla Javascript
document

// jQuery
$('document')
```
