## Loops, Arrays, and HTML/CSS

#### Loops (again)

- Describe how a loop works
- Use a standard **for** loop with an **iterator**
- Use a **for-in** loop with collections
- Describe the difference between these types of loops

#### Objects

- Describe **key-value** pair storage
- Utilize **key-value** storage
- Access and assign values in an object
- Iterate through an object

#### Re-Introduction to HTML & CSS

- Understand what the DOM is
- Understand and apply the CSS Cascade
- Create and style a web page

### HTML/CSS Basics

Every HTML file should be thought of as a document. HTML is a markup language. Markup languages describe content - they don't take input or return output like programming languages do.

The DOM stands for the __Document Object Model__. It's your browser's interpretation of the code you wrote. Your browser may interpret your HTML differently than how you wrote it. [This article explains it better than I did in class](https://css-tricks.com/dom/).

The pre-work covered HTML and CSS and you guys are clearly very familiar with it so here's a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript playground you can use to test your skills:

- Use CSS to change the colors and sizes of text and other elements on the page
- Add a title to the top of the page in HTML
- Use JavaScript to loop over the `posts` array and output the front page of an example blog
