# 1. HTML, CSS, & Javascript

## Homework

For your first week of WDI, you will be asked to read a lot of programming text. You are meant to read each chapter first before attempting to re-create the code. You should gain a higher level picture of what you are trying to accomplish before you attempt to follow along in programming books. This is a common pitfall many new developers fall into.

You will also be assigned labs to complete and practice your newly learned skills. Those assignments will be added throughout the week.
