## Practice loop and function problems

#### These get harder as you go down the list.  We don't EXPECT you to finish all these.
#### We are giving you this many problems because students are at different ability levels right now. 

1.  Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").
Bonus: Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).

3.  Write a function named assignGrade that:
takes 1 argument, a number score(examle: 89 returns B).
returns a grade for the score, either "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F".
Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.

4.  Check the results of assignGrade function from the previous exercise for every value from 60 to 100 - so your log should show "For 89, you got a B. For 90, you got an A.", etc. 

5. Write a function named `tellFortune` that:

- Takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
- Tutputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
- Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

6. Write a JavaScript function which will take an array of numbers stored and find the second lowest and second greatest numbers, respectively. 
Sample array : [1,2,3,4,5]
Expected Output : 2,4 

7. Write a JavaScript function that accepts two arguments, a string and a letter and the function will count the number of occurrences of the specified letter within the string. Go to the editor
Sample arguments : 'Listen to the river sing sweet songs, 'o' 
Expected output : 1 

8.  Write a JavaScript function that accept a list of country names as input and returns the longest country name as output. Go to the editor 
Sample function : Longest_Country_Name(["Australia", "Germany", "United States of America"])
Expected output : "United States of America"

9.  Write a JavaScript function that reverse a number. 
Example x = 32243;
Expected Output : 34223 

10. Write a JavaScript function that will find the largest of five numbers. Display an alert box to show the result. 
Sample numbers : -5, -2, -6, 0, -1 
Output : 0 

11.  Write a JavaScript conditional statement to sort three numbers. Display an alert box to show the result. 
Sample numbers : 0, -1, 4 
Output : 4, 0, -1 

12. Write a JavaScript function to get the first element of an array. Passing a parameter 'n' will return the first 'n' elements of the array. 
Test Data : 
console.log(first([7, 9, 0, -2])); 
console.log(first([],3));
console.log(first([7, 9, 0, -2],3));
console.log(first([7, 9, 0, -2],6));
console.log(first([7, 9, 0, -2],-3));
Expected Output : 
7
[] 
[7, 9, 0] 
[7, 9, 0, -2] 
[] 

13. Write a simple JavaScript program to join all elements of the following array into a string. 
Sample array : myColor = ["Red", "Green", "White", "Black"];
Expected Output : 
"Red,Green,White,Black"

14.  Write a JavaScript program which accept a number as input and insert dashes (-) between each two even numbers. For example if you accept 025468 the output should be 0-254-6-8.

15. Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent item of an array. 
Sample array : var arr1=[3, 'a', 'a', 'a', 2, 3, 'a', 3, 'a', 2, 4, 9, 3];
Sample Output : a ( 5 times ) 

16. explore something, maybe canvas, maybe velocity.js, tween.js, random codepens.
