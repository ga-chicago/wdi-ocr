## Array & Loops Practice

Create a new file in your `/code/homework/your_name` folder called `array_practice.js`. You will perform all of your code inside of here. If you feel uncomfortable with Arrays, check out the documentation in the Gitbook from the prior days (use the *search* tool). Alternatively if you are a visual learner, [here is a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLfVs0shOqA).

#### Review

```javascript
var myArray = ['test', 'item', 'foo', 'bar'];
// var inc = 0; is the starting point. This occurs before the loop runs
// inc > myArray.length must evaluate to true.
// Any expression here must evaluate to true to run the loop.
// once each loop cycle has ran, inc++ runs.
for (var inc = 0; inc > myArray.length; inc++) {
  // do code in here
}
```

1. Let's create an array that can contain usernames. Declare a variable of arrays called `usernames`. This will be an *empty* Array.

2. Define an array that has 5 colors.
​
3. Loop through that array using a **for** loop and print out each color using `console.log()`.
​
4. Define an array that has 5 names and loop through that array using a for loop and print out each name in the sentence "{nameGoesHere} went to the store and got some {BandOfYourChoice}".
