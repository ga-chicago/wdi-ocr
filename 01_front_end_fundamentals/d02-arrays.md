<strong>Javascript</strong>
<h3>Arrays</h3>

---


##Summary

We can access an array's items using **indices**. Arrays have a variety of methods to utilize.

##Discussion

```javascript
var myArray = ["James", "Bill", "Jim"];
myArray[0]; // this will return "Alex"
// let's assign a new value to "James"
myArray[2] = "Ravenclaw";
```
We also covered a lot of **methods** that each array has. Here are the methods we used.
- **pop()** - removes and returns the the *last* item in the array.
- **push()** - adds an item to the end of the array.
- **shift()** - removes the *first* item in an array.
- **unshift()** - adds an item to the *start* of the array.
- **reverse()** - reverses the order of an array.
- **sort()** - sorts an array by alpha-numerics, based on the first character read.
