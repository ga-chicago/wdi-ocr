## Bash Profile

The `~/.bash_profile` file allows you to maintain links to various applications from the command line and setup our development environment. There are other files we can use to modify these but today we just want to be able to open files in Chrome, Safari, Sublime Text, WebStorm, and other files.

To do that you will need to partner up with someone. You're going to work together once you have everything installed on your computer to create aliases on your computer. This will require you to put your terminal knowledge to the test!

#### Goals

- Edit the `~/bash_profile` file
- File the exact path using `pwd` and tab-completion of apps
- Add `alias` for each application so files may be opened
- Open files and/or folders using `your_alias_name .` to test your script


##### Editing Bash Profile

- Navigate to your home directory using `cd`
- Open your `.bash_profile` file using `open .bash_profile`; this will open the file in your editor
- It might look like the following:

```bash
PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"
```

##### Locating Application

> **Apps** - you should find Safari, Chrome, Sublime Text, and WebStorm. Additionally, you may find Atom and any other editor/browser you like.

- In a new terminal tab, navigate to the root of your hard drive using `cd /`
- `cd` into the `Applications` directory
- `ls -l` to list all of your Applications
- Copy the application name to a blank text file (such as `/Applications/WebStorm.app`)
- Repeat for each app

##### Adding Aliases

- At the **end** of your `.bash_profile` file, you may add an alias. You'll need the exact path of your apps to do so.
- You can add an alias by assigning a _command_ like so: `alias ws='open -a /Applications/WebStorm.app'`
- Here are the aliases you should use for each app:
  * `ws` for WebStorm
  * `subl` for Sublime Text
  * `safari` for Safari
  * `chrome` for Chrome

##### Testing

- Save your `.bash_profile`
- Restart your terminal (and close all tabs)
- Until you close & restart terminal, your profile changes will not be seen!
- Create an HTML file using the `touch` command.
- Open it with each application you found!
